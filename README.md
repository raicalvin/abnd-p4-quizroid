## About
Quizroid is a single-screen educational app that consists of a handful of questions about Android programming. In this project, we were tasked with created a set of questions using editable fields, radio buttons, checkboxes, and a feature to check each answer and display the results.

## User Interface

I decided to layout a clean and minimal UI with a bright blue and white color scheme to put the quiz-taker in a very focused mindset when using the app. The 'NEXT' and 'BACK' buttons are used to scroll to the following and prior questions, respectively.
