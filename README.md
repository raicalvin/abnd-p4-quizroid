# Android App: Quizroid

## Project Information

### Synopsis

Quizroid is a single-screen educational app that consists of a handful of questions about Android programming. In this project, we were tasked with created a set of questions using editable fields, radio buttons, checkboxes, and a feature to check each answer and display the results.

### Motivation

This project was created for my Android Basics Nanodegree program with Udacity. I set to create a clean and easy-to-use UI for navigating through the set of questions while using a ScrollView with scroll animations to make the transitions between questions fluid.

## User Interface

I decided to layout a clean and minimal UI with a bright blue and white color scheme to put the quiz-taker in a very focused mindset when using the app. The 'NEXT' and 'BACK' buttons are used to scroll to the following and prior questions, respectively.
